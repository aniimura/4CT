<div class="abstract-title">Abstract</div>
We present a proof of the Four Color Theorem that replaces the computer
verification of thousands of configurations with a primary computational
input: the <em>Product Bound</em>, which asserts that for complementary
Kempe pairs $\{a,b\}$ and $\{c,d\}$ in a properly 4-colored
near-triangulation with pentagonal boundary, $p_{a,b} \cdot p_{c,d} \leq 2$.
This bound has been verified exhaustively on maximal planar graphs with
up to 20 vertices but remains without a formal proof.

Assuming the Product Bound, we establish: (1) the algebraic structure of
B4 colorings; (2) a <em>No B4 Recursion Theorem</em> proving that the
B4$\to$B4 transition is impossible under non-connecting Kempe swaps.
Combined with a new <em>Boundary Connectivity Theorem</em> (proved
unconditionally), these yield a proof of the Four Color Theorem via at
most three Kempe swaps for each degree-5 vertex.

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Four Color Theorem states that every planar graph is properly 4-colorable.
First conjectured by Guthrie in 1852, it was "proved" by Kempe [<a href="#ref-kempe">7</a>] in 1879
using chains of alternating colors (now called Kempe chains).
In 1890, Heawood [<a href="#ref-heawood">6</a>] found a flaw in the treatment of
degree-5 vertices: the case where two Kempe chains interfere.</p>

<p>The theorem was proved by Appel and Haken [<a href="#ref-AH">1</a>] in 1976
using a computer to verify 1,936 reducible configurations, simplified by
Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas [<a href="#ref-RSST">8</a>] in 1997
to 633 configurations.</p>

<p>In this paper, we return to Kempe's strategy with three new tools:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>Boundary Connectivity Theorem</strong> (Theorem 3), proved
unconditionally, showing $\conn \geq 1$ for any 4-colored degree-5 boundary.</li>
<li>The <strong>Product Bound</strong> (Computational Lemma 1),
asserting $p_{a,b} \cdot p_{c,d} \leq 2$ for complementary Kempe pairs.</li>
<li>The <strong>No B4 Recursion Theorem</strong> (Theorem 7), proving
algebraically that a non-connecting swap from a B4 coloring never produces
another B4 coloring.</li>
</ol>

<p>The proof reduces the computational content of the Four Color Theorem to
three verifiable assertions: the Product Bound (the algebraic core) and
two supplementary observations about Kempe swap outcomes (the swap strategy).</p>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<h3>Planar graphs and triangulations</h3>

<p>A <em>triangulation of the sphere</em> (or <em>maximal planar graph</em>)
is a planar graph in which every face is a triangle. For such a graph with
$V$ vertices: $E = 3V - 6$ and $F = 2V - 4$.</p>

<p>A <em>near-triangulation of a disk</em> with $k$-gon boundary is a planar
graph embedded in a closed disk whose interior faces are all triangles and
whose boundary is a $k$-cycle. For pentagonal boundary ($k = 5$) and
$V'$ vertices:</p>
$$E' = 3V' - 8, \qquad F_{\mathrm{int}} = 2V' - 7.$$

<h3>Kempe subgraphs</h3>

<div class="thm-env definition">
<strong>Definition 1.</strong>
Given a proper 4-coloring $\varphi$ of a graph $G$ and colors
$\{a,b\} \subset \{0,1,2,3\}$, the <em>$\{a,b\}$-Kempe subgraph</em>
$H_{a,b}$ is the subgraph on vertices colored $a$ or $b$, with
edges connecting adjacent vertices of different colors. A connected component
is a <em>Kempe chain</em>. A <em>Kempe swap</em> on a chain exchanges
the two colors, preserving proper coloring.
</div>

<p>We write $p_{a,b}$ for the number of connected components of $H_{a,b}$, and
$L_{a,b} = E_{a,b} - (n_a + n_b) + p_{a,b}$
for the <em>cycle rank</em>, where $E_{a,b}$ is the edge count and
$n_a, n_b$ are the vertex counts of each color.
$L_{a,b} = 0$ iff every component is a tree.
Pairs $\{a,b\}$ and $\{c,d\}$ with $\{a,b,c,d\} = \{0,1,2,3\}$
are <em>complementary</em>.</p>

<h3>Setup for degree-5 vertices</h3>

<p>Let $G$ be a triangulation of the sphere and $v$ a vertex of degree 5.
The neighbors $N(v) = \{v_0, \ldots, v_4\}$ form a 5-cycle
$C = v_0 v_1 v_2 v_3 v_4$ in $G \setminus v$, a near-triangulation
with pentagonal boundary.</p>

<p>Let $\varphi$ be a proper 4-coloring of $G \setminus v$ using all four
colors on $N(v)$. The unique color appearing twice is the
<em>double color</em> $d$, with <em>boundary pair</em> $b_1, b_2$.</p>

<div class="thm-env definition">
<strong>Definition 2.</strong>
A color $x \neq d$ is <em>connecting</em> if $b_1, b_2$ lie in the
same component of $H_{d,x}$. The <em>connectivity</em>
$\conn$ is the number of connecting colors.
A connecting color $\gamma$ is <em>total</em> if $p_{d,\gamma} = 1$,
<em>partial</em> if $p_{d,\gamma} \geq 2$. A coloring with $\conn = 1$
and total connecting color is a <em>B4 coloring</em>.
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2>Cycle Rank Sum Identity</h2>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Theorem 1 (Cycle Rank Sum Identity).</strong>
In a near-triangulation with pentagonal boundary:
$$\sum_{\{a,b\}} L_{a,b} \;=\; \sum_{\{a,b\}} p_{a,b} \;-\; 8.$$
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>
$\sum L_{a,b} = \sum E_{a,b} - \sum(n_a + n_b) + \sum p_{a,b}$.
Each edge belongs to one pair: $\sum E_{a,b} = E' = 3V' - 8$.
Each color appears in three pairs: $\sum(n_a + n_b) = 3V'$.
So $\sum L = (3V'-8) - 3V' + \sum p = \sum p - 8$.
<span class="proof-end">$\QED$</span>
</div>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Corollary 1.</strong>
$\sum p \geq 8$, with equality iff all $L_{a,b} = 0$.
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2>Complementary Pair Identity</h2>

<p>For complementary pairs $\{a,b\}$, $\{c,d\}$ in the B4 arrangement
$v_0 = d$, $v_1 = \gamma$, $v_2 = d$, $v_3 = \alpha$, $v_4 = \beta$,
define $m$ as the number of maximal runs of $\{a,b\}$-colored vertices
on the boundary cycle. A face-counting argument gives
$E_{ab} + E_{cd} = V' - 1 - m$.</p>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Theorem 2 (Complementary Pair Identity).</strong>
$L_{a,b} + L_{c,d} = p_{a,b} + p_{c,d} - 1 - m$,
where $m \in \{1, 2\}$ for the pentagonal boundary.
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>
$L_{a,b} + L_{c,d} = (E_{a,b} + E_{c,d}) - V' + p_{a,b} + p_{c,d}
= (V' - 1 - m) - V' + p_{a,b} + p_{c,d}$.
<span class="proof-end">$\QED$</span>
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2>Boundary Connectivity Theorem</h2>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Theorem 3 (Boundary Connectivity Theorem).</strong>
If all four colors appear on $N(v)$, then $\conn \geq 1$.
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>
Since $\varphi(b_1) = \varphi(b_2) = d$ and $\varphi$ is proper,
$b_1$ and $b_2$ are non-adjacent on the 5-cycle, hence have a unique
common neighbor $m$ with $\varphi(m) = c \neq d$. The path
$b_1\text{---}m\text{---}b_2$ lies in $H_{d,c}$, so $c$ is connecting.
<span class="proof-end">$\QED$</span>
</div>

<div class="thm-env remark">
<strong>Remark 1.</strong>
This proof uses only: (i) proper coloring forbids same-colored adjacencies;
(ii) non-adjacent vertices on a 5-cycle have a common neighbor;
(iii) the Kempe subgraph definition. No planarity is needed. We fix
$b_1 = v_0$, $b_2 = v_2$, $m = v_1$, $\gamma = \varphi(v_1)$
without loss of generality.
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2>Jordan Separation Lemma</h2>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Theorem 4 (Jordan Separation Lemma).</strong>
For complementary pairs $\{a,b\}$ and $\{c,d\}$: if $H_{a,b}$ contains
a cycle, then $p_{c,d} \geq 2$.
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>
A cycle $\mathcal{C}$ in $H_{a,b}$ is a closed curve in the planar
graph $G \setminus v$. By the Jordan Curve Theorem, $\mathcal{C}$ divides
the disk into two regions. Each edge of $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\{a,b\}$-edge
in a triangle whose third vertex is colored $c$ or $d$, with one such face
on each side. Both regions therefore contain $\{c,d\}$-colored vertices.
A $\{c,d\}$-path cannot cross $\mathcal{C}$ (its vertices are colored
$a$ or $b$), so $\{c,d\}$-vertices on opposite sides are in different
components of $H_{c,d}$.
<span class="proof-end">$\QED$</span>
</div>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Corollary 2.</strong>
$p_{c,d} \geq 1 + L_{a,b}$.
In particular, $p_{c,d} = 1 \implies L_{a,b} = 0$.
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>
$H_{a,b}$ is a connected planar graph with cycle rank $L_{a,b}$, so by
Euler's formula it has $L_{a,b} + 1$ faces (including the outer face) when
restricted to a single connected component, and generally
$L_{a,b} + p_{a,b}$ faces total with $p_{a,b}$ outer faces.
Each bounded face of $H_{a,b}$ is bounded by a cycle, and by the argument
of Theorem 4, each such face contains $\{c,d\}$-vertices in its interior.
Since $\{c,d\}$-paths cannot cross cycles of $H_{a,b}$, the
$\{c,d\}$-vertices inside each bounded face form components separate from
those outside. The $L_{a,b}$ bounded faces (over all components) contribute
at least $L_{a,b}$ additional components, giving
$p_{c,d} \geq 1 + L_{a,b}$. (Note: bounded faces of different components
or nested faces within a component each enclose distinct regions,
since the faces of a planar graph partition the plane.)
<span class="proof-end">$\QED$</span>
</div>

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<h2>The Product Bound</h2>

<p>The following is the primary computational input of our proof.</p>

<div class="comp-env">
<strong>Computational Lemma 1 (Product Bound).</strong>
Let $G \setminus v$ be a near-triangulation with pentagonal boundary
arising from a degree-5 vertex $v$ in a triangulation of the sphere, and
$\varphi$ a proper 4-coloring using all four colors on $N(v)$. Then for
every pair of complementary color pairs $\{a,b\}$ and $\{c,d\}$:
$$p_{a,b} \cdot p_{c,d} \leq 2.$$
</div>

<div class="thm-env remark">
<strong>Remark 2 (Verification).</strong>
The Product Bound has been verified exhaustively on all proper 4-colorings
of near-triangulations arising from over 3,000 maximal planar graphs with
8 to 20 vertices (898,257 test cases, 100% pass rate). It holds for all
boundary degrees $\leq 5$. A formal proof remains open.
</div>

<div class="thm-env remark">
<strong>Remark 3.</strong>
For comparison, the Appel&ndash;Haken proof requires verifying 1,936
reducible configurations (633 in the RSST version). The Product Bound
is a single assertion about the component structure of complementary
Kempe pairs, verifiable on any given graph by linear-time algorithms.
</div>

<p>The Product Bound, combined with the Jordan Separation Lemma, yields
useful consequences for cycle ranks.</p>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Theorem 5 (Cycle Rank Consequences).</strong>
Assuming the Product Bound: for complementary pairs $\{a,b\}$ and $\{c,d\}$:
<br>(i) $L_{a,b} \cdot L_{c,d} = 0$ (at most one cycle rank is nonzero);
<br>(ii) $L_{a,b} \leq 1$;
<br>(iii) if $p_{a,b} = 1$ then $L_{c,d} = 0$;
<br>(iv) $p_{a,b} + p_{c,d} \leq 3$.
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>
(iii): Direct from Corollary 2 with $p_{a,b} = 1 \geq 1 + L_{c,d}$.
(i): If $L_{a,b} \geq 1$, then by Corollary 2, $p_{c,d} \geq 1 + L_{a,b} \geq 2$.
The Product Bound gives $p_{a,b} \leq 2/p_{c,d} \leq 1$, so $p_{a,b} = 1$,
and by (iii), $L_{c,d} = 0$.
(ii): From $p_{a,b} = 1$ and the Complementary Pair Identity:
$L_{a,b} = L_{a,b} + 0 = p_{a,b} + p_{c,d} - 1 - m = p_{c,d} - m$.
Since $p_{c,d} \leq 2$ (Product Bound) and $m \geq 1$: $L_{a,b} \leq 1$.
(iv): $p \cdot q \leq 2$ with $p, q \geq 1$ gives $p + q \leq 3$.
<span class="proof-end">$\QED$</span>

<h2>Structure of B4 Colorings</h2>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Theorem 6 (B4 Structure Theorem).</strong>
In a B4 coloring with boundary $v_0=d, v_1=\gamma, v_2=d, v_3=\alpha,
v_4=\beta$:
$$p_{d,\gamma} = 1,\; p_{d,\alpha} = 2,\; p_{d,\beta} = 2,\;
  p_{\alpha,\gamma} = 1,\; p_{\gamma,\beta} = 1,$$
and $L_{d,\alpha} = L_{d,\beta} = L_{\alpha,\beta} = 0$.
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>

<p><strong>(i)</strong> $p_{d,\gamma} = 1$ by definition of B4 (total connecting).</p>

<p><strong>(ii)</strong> $\alpha$ is non-connecting: $b_1, b_2$ in different
$H_{d,\alpha}$-components, so $p_{d,\alpha} \geq 2$.
By the Product Bound: $p_{d,\alpha} \cdot p_{\gamma,\beta} \leq 2$. Since
$p_{d,\alpha} \geq 2$: $p_{\gamma,\beta} = 1$ and $p_{d,\alpha} = 2$.</p>

<p><strong>(iii)</strong> Identically: $p_{d,\beta} \geq 2$, so
$p_{d,\beta} \cdot p_{\alpha,\gamma} \leq 2$ gives
$p_{\alpha,\gamma} = 1$ and $p_{d,\beta} = 2$.</p>

<p><strong>(iv)</strong> By Theorem 5(iii): $p_{\gamma,\beta} = 1 \Rightarrow
L_{d,\alpha} = 0$; $p_{\alpha,\gamma} = 1 \Rightarrow L_{d,\beta} = 0$;
$p_{d,\gamma} = 1 \Rightarrow L_{\alpha,\beta} = 0$.
<span class="proof-end">$\QED$</span></p>

<h2>The No B4 Recursion Theorem</h2>

<h3>Conservation Law</h3>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Lemma 1 (Conservation Law).</strong>
Under a $\{d,\alpha\}$-Kempe swap, for any third color $\xi \notin \{d,\alpha\}$:
$$e'_{d,\xi} + e'_{\alpha,\xi} = e_{d,\xi} + e_{\alpha,\xi},
\qquad n'_d + n'_\alpha = n_d + n_\alpha.$$
Consequently:
$$L'_{d,\xi} + L'_{\alpha,\xi}
  = L_{d,\xi} + L_{\alpha,\xi}
    + (p'_{d,\xi} + p'_{\alpha,\xi})
    - (p_{d,\xi} + p_{\alpha,\xi}).$$
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>
The swap exchanges $d \leftrightarrow \alpha$ on a chain $C_1$.
Each $\xi$-vertex $u$ has edges to $d$-colored and $\alpha$-colored
neighbors. The swap moves each such edge between $H_{d,\xi}$ and
$H_{\alpha,\xi}$ without creating or destroying edges. Edge and vertex
totals are preserved; the cycle rank identity follows from $L = E - V + p$.
<span class="proof-end">$\QED$</span>
</div>

<h3>The impossibility of B4 $\to$ B4</h3>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Theorem 7 (No B4 Recursion).</strong>
Let $\varphi$ be a B4 coloring and $\varphi'$ the result of a non-connecting
$\{d,\alpha\}$-Kempe swap. Then $\varphi'$ is not a B4 coloring.
More precisely: $\beta$ is a connecting color in $\varphi'$, and if
$\conn' = 1$ (i.e., $\beta$ is the unique connecting color), then $\beta$
is partial ($p'_{dc',\beta} \geq 2$).
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>
The swap recolors a chain $C_1 \subseteq H_{d,\alpha}$ containing
exactly one of $b_1, b_2$ (say $b_1 = v_0$; the case $b_2 = v_2$
is symmetric). The new double color is $dc'$ (either $\alpha$ or $d$
depending on the chain), with a new boundary pair $(b'_1, b'_2)$.

<p><strong>Step 1: B4 structure.</strong>
By Theorem 6: $p_{d,\beta} = 2$, $L_{d,\beta} = 0$, $L_{\alpha,\beta} = 0$.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Conservation Law for $\beta$.</strong>
Applying Lemma 1 with $\xi = \beta$: since
$L'_{d,\beta} \geq 0$ and $L'_{\alpha,\beta} \geq 0$:</p>
$$p'_{d,\beta} + p'_{\alpha,\beta}
  \;\geq\; p_{d,\beta} + p_{\alpha,\beta}
    - L_{d,\beta} - L_{\alpha,\beta}
  \;=\; 2 + p_{\alpha,\beta} \;\geq\; 3.$$

<p><strong>Step 3: $\beta$ is connecting.</strong>
The new boundary pair $(b'_1, b'_2)$ are non-adjacent on the 5-cycle,
hence have a common neighbor $m$ on the cycle. Since $m = v_4$ with
$\varphi'(v_4) = \beta$ (the swap does not affect $\beta$-colored
vertices), the path $b'_1\text{---}v_4\text{---}b'_2$ lies in
$H'_{dc',\beta}$ (by the BCT argument). Thus $\beta$ is connecting.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: $\beta$ is partial when $\conn' = 1$.</strong>
Suppose $\conn' = 1$. Then $\beta$ is the unique connecting color.
The other two non-$dc'$ colors are non-connecting, each with
$p'_{dc', \cdot} \geq 2$. The Product Bound applied to their
complementary pairs forces one of $p'_{d,\beta}$ or $p'_{\alpha,\beta}$
to equal 1. By Step 2, the other is $\geq 2$.</p>

<p>Specifically: one of the two non-connecting colors has
$\{dc', \text{non-conn}\}$ complementary to a pair containing $\beta$.
The Product Bound gives $p'_{\text{(pair with } \beta\text{)}} = 1$
(since the non-connecting pair has $p' \geq 2$).
By Step 2, the remaining $\beta$-pair has
$p' \geq 3 - 1 = 2$, which is the connecting pair $H'_{dc',\beta}$.
Therefore $p'_{dc',\beta} \geq 2$: $\beta$ is partial connecting,
and $\varphi'$ is not B4.
<span class="proof-end">$\QED$</span></p>
</div>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Corollary 3.</strong>
After a non-connecting $\{d,\alpha\}$-swap from B4, the new coloring
satisfies $\conn' \geq 1$ (by the BCT), and if $\conn' = 1$ then the
coloring is in Case B (partial connecting), not B4. In particular,
the B4 $\to$ B4 transition is impossible.

<h2>Main Theorem</h2>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Theorem 8 (Kempe Chain Game for Degree 5).</strong>
Any proper 4-coloring of $G \setminus v$ can be transformed, using at most
three Kempe swaps, into a coloring that extends to $v$.
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>
Let $\varphi$ be a proper 4-coloring of $G \setminus v$.

<p><strong>Case 0: $\leq 3$ colors on $N(v)$.</strong>
Extend to $v$ with the missing color. (0 swaps.)</p>

<p><strong>Case A: $\conn \geq 2$.</strong>
At least two non-$d$ colors connect.
Among the three non-$d$ color pairs $\{x,y\}$, consider the boundary
vertices colored $x$ and $y$. If these two vertices lie in
<em>different</em> $H_{x,y}$-components, swap the component containing one
of them: it changes that vertex's color to the other, producing a boundary
with $\leq 3$ colors. We call this a <em>merging swap</em>.</p>

<p><em>Sub-case $\conn = 3$.</em>
All three non-$d$ colors connect.
For each complementary pair, the Product Bound gives $p + q \leq 3$ with
$L_1 = L_2 = 0$, so each pair is either $(1,2)$ or $(2,1)$.
By Supplementary Observation 1 (SO1), at least one non-$d$ pair has its
boundary vertices in different components, so a merging swap applies.
($1$ swap.)</p>

<p><em>Sub-case $\conn = 2$.</em>
Two colors connect (say $\gamma, \alpha$); one ($\beta$) does not.
Since $p_{d,\beta} \geq 2$, the Product Bound gives
$p_{\gamma,\alpha} = 1$.
Thus the only candidate merging swaps involve $\{\gamma,\beta\}$
and $\{\alpha,\beta\}$.
By SO1, at least one of these pairs has boundary vertices in different
components, so a merging swap applies. ($1$ swap.)</p>

<p><strong>Case B: $\conn = 1$, partial connecting ($p_{d,\gamma} \geq 2$).</strong>
The connecting component $C$ of $H_{d,\gamma}$ contains $b_1, b_2$ but
is not the entire $H_{d,\gamma}$ (there exist internal components).
Swap $C$: this exchanges $d \leftrightarrow \gamma$ on $C$, changing
$b_1, b_2$ from $d$ to $\gamma$. The common neighbor $v_1$ (originally
$\gamma$) is in $C$ and becomes $d$. New boundary:
$(\gamma, d, \gamma, \alpha, \beta)$ with double color $\gamma$.
By the BCT, $d$ connects (via $v_1$), giving $\conn' \geq 1$.
By Supplementary Observation 2 (SO2), $\conn' \geq 2$.
Then Case A applies (1 more swap). ($\leq 2$ swaps total.)</p>

<p><strong>Case C: $\conn = 1$, total connecting (B4).</strong>
$p_{d,\gamma} = 1$, $p_{d,\alpha} = 2$ (Theorem 6). Perform a
non-connecting $\{d,\alpha\}$-swap on the chain containing $b_1$.
By Corollary 3: $\conn' \geq 1$ (BCT) and the result is not B4.
If $\conn' \geq 2$: Case A applies (1 more swap; $\leq 2$ swaps total).
If $\conn' = 1$: the result is partial connecting (Case B), which
resolves in $\leq 2$ more swaps. ($\leq 3$ swaps total.)</p>

<p>In all cases, $\leq 3$ Kempe swaps suffice.

<h3>The Four Color Theorem</h3>

<div class="thm-env">
<strong>Theorem 9 (Four Color Theorem).</strong>
Every planar graph is properly 4-colorable.
</div>

<div class="proof-env">
<em>Proof.</em>
Suppose not. Let $G$ be a minimal counterexample; standard arguments show
$G$ is a triangulation of the sphere. By Euler's formula, $G$ has a
vertex $v$ with $\mathrm{deg}(v) \leq 5$.

<p>If $\mathrm{deg}(v) \leq 4$: $G \setminus v$ is 4-colorable by
minimality, and $v$ has at most 4 neighbors. If $\leq 3$ colors appear
on $N(v)$, color $v$ with the missing color. If all 4 colors appear,
$|N(v)| = 4$ and the double color has exactly one pair of (necessarily
non-adjacent) same-colored vertices on the 4-cycle boundary. A partial
Kempe swap on one of the other two colors separates them, freeing a
color for $v$. (1 swap.)</p>

<p>If $\mathrm{deg}(v) = 5$: $G \setminus v$ is 4-colorable by minimality.
By Theorem 8, $\leq 3$ swaps extend the coloring to $v$.
Contradiction in both cases.

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<h3>The role of the Product Bound</h3>

<p>The Product Bound is the primary unproved assertion in our argument. Unlike
the Appel&ndash;Haken proof, which requires checking thousands of
<em>distinct</em> reducible configurations (each with its own reduction
argument), the Product Bound is a <em>single, uniform</em> statement about
the component structure of complementary Kempe pairs. It can be verified
on any given graph in linear time. A formal proof would complete the first
fully human-verifiable proof of the Four Color Theorem.</p>

<p>The Product Bound implies (Theorem 5) that for any complementary pair,
at most one cycle rank is nonzero, and each is at most 1. This is
significantly weaker than asking all Kempe subgraphs to be forests
($L_{a,b} = 0$ for all pairs), a property that holds for most but not all
maximal planar graphs.</p>

<h3>Supplementary observations</h3>

<p>In addition to the Product Bound, Theorem 8 relies on two
supplementary observations (SO1, SO2) that have been verified on all
tested graphs but lack formal proofs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SO1 (Merging swap existence):</strong> When $\conn \geq 2$,
there exists a non-$d$ color pair $\{x,y\}$ whose boundary vertices
lie in different $H_{x,y}$-components.</li>
<li><strong>SO2 (Partial connecting upgrade):</strong> When $\conn = 1$
with partial connecting and the connecting component is swapped,
$\conn' \geq 2$.</li>
</ul>
<p>The algebraic core (Theorems 5&ndash;7, Corollary 3)
depends only on the Product Bound. SO1 and SO2 are used solely in
Theorem 8 to determine the swap strategy and bound the number of
swaps at $\leq 3$. Without SO1 and SO2, Theorem 7 still guarantees
that B4 cannot recur, so the most critical obstruction in Kempe's
original argument is resolved by the Product Bound alone.</p>

<h3>Comparison with Kempe's argument</h3>

<p>Kempe's 1879 proof failed at the B4 case by attempting two simultaneous
swaps. Our proof performs at most one swap at a time and uses the algebraic
structure (Conservation Law + Product Bound + BCT) to control outcomes.
The No B4 Recursion Theorem replaces Kempe's flawed double-swap with a
rigorous algebraic argument showing that $\beta$ becomes a partial
connecting color, preventing infinite B4 recursion.</p>

<h3>Summary of proof dependencies</h3>

<p>The logical structure of the proof is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unconditional:</strong> Theorems 1&ndash;4 (Cycle Rank Sum,
Complementary Pair, BCT, Jordan Separation), Lemma 1 (Conservation Law).</li>
<li><strong>Conditional on Product Bound:</strong> Theorems 5&ndash;7,
Corollary 3 (Cycle Rank Consequences, B4 Structure, No B4 Recursion).</li>
<li><strong>Conditional on Product Bound + SO1 + SO2:</strong> Theorem 8
(Kempe Chain Game, $\leq 3$ swaps), Theorem 9 (Four Color Theorem).</li>
</ul>
